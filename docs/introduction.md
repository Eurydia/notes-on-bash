Summarized from [What is Bash?](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#What-is-Bash_003f).

Bash is the default **shell** for the GNU operating system. Its name is an acronym which stands for "**B**ourne-**a**gain **Sh**ell." It is a direct successor to the **sh** shell of the Unix operating system developed by Stephen Bourne.

The GNU operating system has more than one shell, but Bash remains the default.

## What is a shell?

Summarized from [What is a shell?](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#What-is-a-shell_003f).

In general, a shell is responsible for executing commands on an operating system.

A Unix shell serves two purpose; (1) as a command interpreter, it connects the users to the operating system and provides command-line interface, (2) as a programming language, it enables the execution of complex commands that would not make sense to execute on the command-line interface.

A shell has two modes; (1) in interactive mode, it reads input from the keyboard, and (2) in non-interactive mode, it reads input from a file.

A shell command may be executed synchronously or asynchronously.
